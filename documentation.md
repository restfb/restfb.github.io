Welcome to the {{site.title.dark}} documentation. 

Here you find basic information how the {{site.title.dark}} library is used. All the different 
topics are handled here, but we only give a overview over the usage of the library. If you need
a more in depth view and more information have a look at the cookbook. There you'll find a lot of
recipes that cover the advanced usage of {{site.title.dark}}.
