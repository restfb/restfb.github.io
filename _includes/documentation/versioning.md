At the start of 2022, we decided to switch our versioning scheme for RestFB from pure [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/). We made this decision to provide developers with a better understanding of when a particular release was made. With the high frequency of changes in the social media space, we felt that it was important to provide more context around each release.

Under our new versioning scheme, the major version number indicates the year of the release, while the minor version number corresponds to the releases within the year.<br>For example, the 9th release of 2022 would be identified as version 2022.9.0.

We want to assure our users that we will continue to maintain our policy of only making breaking changes to the RestFB API when there is a major position change in the version. This means that such changes will only occur at the turn of the year. This helps to minimize the impact of any changes on existing applications.
