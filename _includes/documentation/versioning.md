In January 2022 we changed the versioning scheme from pure [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/). We think this step was necessary to give the developers a better understanding of the age of the release. There is a very high frequency of changes, especially in the social media area, and we want to map this accordingly in RestFB with the new version scheme.

Of course, we are still maintaining our policy and will only issue breaking changes to the RestFB API if there is a major position change in the version. This automatically means that breaking changes can only occur at the turn of the year.

The minor version then corresponds to counters within the year.<br>
*As an example:* The 9th release 2022 then has the version number 2022.9.0.
