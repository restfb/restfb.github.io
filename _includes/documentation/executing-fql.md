	<h4>FQL is deprecated and removed with Graph API 2.1</h4>
	<div>
		<p>With Graph API 2.1, Facebook discontinued support for FQL (Facebook Query Language). All applications using Graph 2.1 or newer need to change their request and should work with the Graph API.</p>
		<p>Because not every kind of request can transferred to Graph API, you should have a look at the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks/" target="_blank">Webhooks (former Real-Time Updates)</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		We support Webhooks with special types and you should look at the <a href="#using-webhooks">Webhooks section in this documentation</a>.
