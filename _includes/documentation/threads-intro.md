On 18th of July 2024 a new API was introduced by Meta and so the developers got access to Threads. Threads is a text based social network from Meta that is thightly connected to Instagram, but very similar to Twitter. You can send text messages with 500 chars, images, videos and combination of these. 

Since RestFB 2024.8.0, we support the Threads API. But Threads is very special and so our integration is abit different from the common integrations we provide for WhatsApp Business API, Facebook Graph API and the Instagram Business API. 

The Instagram Basic Display API is very similar to the Threads API and so we have also a special integration for this.
