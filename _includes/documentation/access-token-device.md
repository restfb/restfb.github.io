	<h4>Important change with Graph API 2.6</h4>
	<div>Facebook made a breaking change with Graph API 2.6 and the process for acquiring a device access token changed. The most important change is the requirement for a special access token. This consists of the application id AND a client token. Both values are used to build the new access token. RestFB supports the new way to fetch the device access token and the following documentation explains how both ways work.</div>
</div>

With the Device Access Token, Facebook provides functionality to connect to devices with limited input or display capabilities. 

The device access token is generated using a two-step process. First, you have to call <code>FacebookClient.fetchDeviceCode</code>(see example code). You receive a user code, a code and some additional information. The user code has to be shown to the user and she has to enter it on a special Facebook page. The url of that page is part of the DeviceCode object. You should not hardcode this url, because Facebook might change it. As soon as you present this information to the user, you have to poll Facebook and try to fetch the device access token.


### Fetching the Device Access Token

With Graph API 2.6, Facebook changed the way a device token is requested. First we need a special access token that consists of the `application id` and the `client token`. The client token can be found in the Application Dashboard. The new token looks like `<app_id>|<client_token>`. With this access token, a new `FacebookClient` is created and the client is used for the device token interactions with Facebook. Because the application id is part of the access token we don't need to provide the application id in the method call. So we have two new methods that work with this access token and don't use the application id as parameter.

The first part - fetching the `DeviceCode` - looks like this: 
{% highlight java %}
String specialAccessToken = MY_APP_ID + "|" + MY_CLIENT_TOKEN;
DefaultFacebookClient deviceTokenClient = 
         new DefaultFacebookClient(specialAccessToken, Version.LATEST);
ScopeBuilder scope = new ScopeBuilder();

DeviceCode deviceCode = client.fetchDeviceCode(scope);

out.println("Open in a browser: " + deviceCode.getVerificationUri);
out.println("Enter this Code: " + deviceCode.getUserCode);
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have to call the polling call in a loop and can receive the same exceptions as in earlier versions. One change is important: there is no `FacebookDeviceTokenDeclinedException` because this information is not sent to the application. This is an important change, because you have to handle this in your application. You can run into the code expired exception or you let the user close a dialog or something and stop the polling in respect to the user action.

The polling call doesn't need the application id, so it looks like this:
{% highlight java %}
// Obtains an access token which can be used to perform Graph API operations
// on behalf of a user.

AccessToken accessToken =
   deviceTokenClient.obtainDeviceAccessToken(deviceCode.getCode());

out.println("My device access token: " + accessToken);
{% endhighlight %}

### The checked device token exception

The polling method should return the AccessToken, but may throw a <a href="/javadoc-2/com/restfb/exception/devicetoken/FacebookDeviceTokenException.html" target="_blank">FacebookDeviceAccessToken</a> exception.
